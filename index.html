      <h3>Design&Development</h3>
      <p class="introduction">As a designer with the background in Mnagement Science(ACCOUNTING),
         i like to tackle my  design problems by developing appropriate
         processes and methods that can integrate design
         into the core competency of a business.
         I understand fully all aspect of design with a balanced mindset
         that focuses on data and research.
         i am more focused on the administrative side of my work.
        (eg building of sites,content marketing,blogging,social media posts and scheduling,
        working on emailnewletters,communicating with clients etc)
        I honestly do not mind any of these tasks.
